        La Grande Est, a picturesque region in northeastern France, offers a
        delightful blend of natural beauty, rich history, and cultural charm. As
        you travel through its verdant landscapes, you'll encounter rolling

        <h5>Travel the long way to Italy</h5>
        <p>
          Traveling to Turin or Milan from London is a scenic journey that can
          take several routes. You can start with the Eurostar to Paris, then
          switch to a high-speed TGV to either city, with Milan reached in just
          over 7 hours 30 minutes and Turin in 6 hours 30 minutes.
          Alternatively, for a longer, more picturesque option, you can take the
          Eurostar to Paris, connect with a TGV to Zurich, and then change onto
          a scenic train through the Swiss Alps, passing through the tiny,
          picturesque country of Liechtenstein before arriving in Milan or
          Turin. This route offers stunning views of the Alps and the
          opportunity to explore charming Swiss towns along the way.
