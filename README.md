ChatGPT -- code copilot for planning an order of works. Website generator gave me the idea of "travel destination showcase" and as I'm choosing where to go for our ten years together this seemed ideal. Used to provide copy for text elements. 
My older work - taster day more so, I felt a bit more creative and less lost amongst the trees then. That could easily be perfectionism causing a freeze.

Enjoyed playing with the layout, fixing internal page links as they didn't paste well from older work I tested it on. The website started to flow from my fingertips once the subject was settled in

I started to feed chatgpt my code at the very end to get it to find errors or suggest changes. I was impressed with it wanting Alt text for the background images and how it shown me to do it by putting the text in HTML and hiding it with CSS.
