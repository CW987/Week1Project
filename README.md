ChatGPT -- code copilot for planning an order of works. Website generator gave me the idea of "travel destination showcase" and as I'm choosing where to go for our ten years together this seemed ideal. Used to provide copy for text elements.
My older work - taster day more so, I felt a bit more creative and less lost amongst the trees then. That could easily be perfectionism causing a freeze.

I removed the Benelux section as it kept combining with Italy, and as my final stumbling block I chose to ignore.

I started to feed chatgpt my code at the very end to get it to find errors or suggest changes. I was impressed with it wanting Alt text for the background images and how it shown me to do it by putting the text in HTML and hiding it with CSS.

Reflections:

I successfully implemented the required tags and ensured legibility in my work. For CSS positioning, the results seemed to work relatively well, though I wasn’t fully confident in my execution. I plan to improve this by practicing with interactive games to solidify my understanding. With Flexbox, I achieved functional results but didn’t completely grasp the reasoning behind why it worked. I intend to keep experimenting with it in future projects to build a deeper understanding.
For my first planned project, focusing on end-user goals provided direction, but the results were somewhat scattered as I’m still figuring out how to organise my workflow. My code ended up messy due to frequent cutting and pasting, which disrupted the overall structure. This highlighted the need to identify any gaps in my approach. Over the past week, I avoided asking for help and chose instead to experiment and learn through trial and error. While this approach was rewarding for meeting most requirements, it will likely need to change as the projects grow in complexity.
As a stretch goal, I was particularly drawn to creating a "back-to-top" button because it’s a common feature on websites. I revisited an old project and implemented the feature by exploring code examples from a fellow student, course materials, MDN WebDocs, a book, and ChatGPT. My excitement about this task helped me complete it relatively quickly, though at some cost to the quality of my other work.
